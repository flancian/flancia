I always assumed that, when people dedicated their work, they all first finished the thing and then wrote the dedication. That would mean dedicating (say) a [book](https://anagora.org/book) as a finished object; something concrete that one has put together and can be offered with few reservations.

Belatedly I've come to realize I'm not that kind of person, so I find myself dedicating a draft instead. Writing these lines as I write them now means dedicating a set of ideas first, and my clumsy implementation of these ideas second -- the latter amounting currently to little more than my well meaning but lofty aspirations. 

It seems appropriate, then, to dedicate this fuzzy unfinished thing to a loosely defined group instead of a concrete list of individuals.

Flancia is a work of speculative fiction and praxis in the space of [protopias](https://anagora.org/protopia). It is by its very nature an eternal draft, and is presented as-is and without any guarantees except those of good intention.

Please excuse my many mistakes, and feel free to play [hopscotch](https://anagora.org/hopscotch) as your interest takes you.
