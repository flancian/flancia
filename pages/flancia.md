Welcome to Flancia! 

I always assumed that, when people dedicated books and things, they all first finished the thing and then wrote the dedication. That would mean dedicating the (say) [book](https://anagora.org/book) as a finished object, something concrete that one has created or built and can offer without reservations.

Belatedly I've come to realize I'm not that kind of person, or perhaps I just don't get to live that kind of life; so I find myself dedicating a draft instead. Whatever this thing is, containing these lines you're currently reading.

Writing these lines now means dedicating a set of ideas first, and an implementation second; the latter being maybe just an aspiration. It seems only appropriate, then, to dedicate a set of ideas to a set instead of individuals.

To my [friends](https://anagora.org/friends)! 

May be you happy.

Flancia is a work of speculative fiction and associated practice in the space of [protopian thinking](https://anagora.org/protopian-thinking). It is by its very nature an eternal draft. Please excuse the many mistakes.
