Flancia is [free](https://github.com/flancian/), and of course comes without any warranty. Use at your own risk, and for good.

Flancia currently consists of:

  * The root of a tree, or the website you're reading: [github](https://github.com/flancian/flancia).
  * The [Agora](link://slug/agora), a distributed social knowledge graph: [github](https://github.com/flancian/agora).
      * The [Agora Server](https://anagora.org), a site that lets you interact with the Agora: [github](https://github.com/flancian/agora-server).
      * The [Agora Bridge](https://anagora.org), a set of tools to import information into the Agora: [github](https://github.com/flancian/agora-server).
  * Related efforts like [Flancia home](/homes).

Being open source, the projects listed above need not be limited to what I produce. This is where your stuff would be listed if you contributed to Flancia.

You can send me a Pull Request, an [email](mailto:0@flancia.org), or reach out on the [Fediverse](https://social.coop/@flancian).

Thank you for reading!
