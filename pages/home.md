# Introduction

This article represents some sort of basic formal documentation for a project I've been running together with a willing recipient for a few years.

The project, from my side, consists on putting together and transferring two medium sized grants to help another individual build a home for themselves and their family, when conditions would otherwise not be sufficient for them to do so.

This is a project of the (currently informal) Flancia Foundation as manifested in Switzerland through the actions of a private individual like myself, being a privileged tech worker with some money and time to spare.

This project started as an idea back in ~2021 and builds on an earlier exploration: [In Flancia there is no poverty](https://flancia.org/poverty).  

It took shape and place, as planned, through 2025.

# How it happened

I met an individual from [Yemen](https://anagora.org/yemen) who was in a dire situation and I decided to help them and their family, first recurrently as monthly support. As their lives stabilized (to some extent), I thought of granting them a larger sum to be able to try to build a life somewhere. The individual decided to buy land near Sanaa and build a home for them and their immediate and extended family (>10 people).

# Details

This is a charitable project undertaken by [Flancia Foundation](https://flancia.org) as an idiosyncratic part of the [Effective Altruism](https://effectivealtruism.org) movement.

More details are available on demand. If you represent an organization who needs to know more about this project in particular, please reach out to <0@flancia.org>.
