# Introduction

This article represents some sort of formal documentation for a project I've been running together with a willing recipient for a few years.

The project, from my side, consists in putting together two medium sized (for a private individual like myself) grants to help another individual build a home for themselves and their family, when conditions would otherwise not be sufficient for them to do so.

This project started as an idea back in ~2021 and follows from an earlier exploration: [[In Flancia there is no poverty]].  

It took shape and place, as planned, through 2025.

# How it happened

I met an individual from [[Yemen]] who was in a dire situation and I decided to help them and their family, first recurrently as monthly support. As their lives stabilized (to some extent), I thought of granting them a larger sum to be able to try to build a life somewhere. The individual decided to buy land near Sanaa and build a home for them and their immediate and extended family (>10 people).

# Details

Details are available on demand. This is a charitable project undertaken by [[Flancia]] as an idiosyncratic part of the [[Effective Altruism]] movement.
