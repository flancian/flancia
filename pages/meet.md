* **To join: [anagora.org/go/flancia-meet](https://anagora.org/go/flancia-meet)**.
* **Notes and more: [anagora.org/flancia-meet](https://anagora.org/flancia-meet)**.

Flancia Meet is a weekly video conference where we discuss our projects and goals, and occasionally work in public. As of the time of writing most participants are programmers but you need not be.

We meet on Saturdays. Usually around 11 UTC.

We have a Matrix chat: <https://anagora.org/go/agora-discuss>.

# Values
* **No FOMO.** It's fine to miss these meetings and join sometimes. Sometimes nobody shows up. It's fine.
* **No stress.** It's voluntary and supposed to be fun. It is OK to skip often, or indeed always.
* **We try to practice Loving Kindness and the Principle of Charity** when interacting with each other and with people outside the group.
* **Flancia** values apply. See <https://flancia.org>.
