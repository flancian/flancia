As of [[2022-03-26]]:

- An [[Agora]] exists. It is https://anagora.org.
- [[Flancia Collective]] exists. It is in the Agora.
- I try to write [[Wikilinks Everywhere]], even in platforms that don't yet support wikilink resolution. Please assume that all links point to https://anagora.org; they can be looked up there, or you can automatically resolve them using extensions.

I am back here after a long hiatus. 2020 happened, I was very busy at [[work]] working on [[Covid]] response and then on reliability projects. On my free time I built an Agora: some coding, some writing, lots of meeting interesting people. And, of course, I lived -- we lived :) Happily, I have to say. I am thankful.
