As of [[[2022-03-26](https://anagora.org/2022-03-26)]]:

- An [Agora](https://flancia.org/agora) exists. It is [https://anagora.org](https://anagora.org).
- [Flancia Collective](https://anagora.org/flancia-collective) exists. It is in the Agora.
- I try to write [[[Wikilinks Everywhere](https://anagora.org/wikilinks-everywhere)]], even in platforms that don't yet support wikilink resolution. Please assume that all links point to https://anagora.org; they can be looked up there, or you can automatically resolve them using extensions.

I am back here after a long hiatus. 2020 happened, I was very busy at [[[work](https://anagora.org/work)]] working on [[[Covid](https://anagora.org/covid)]] response and then on reliability projects. On my free time I built [an Agora](https://anagora.org): some coding, some writing, lots of meeting interesting people. And, of course, I lived -- [we lived](https://anagora.org/lady-burup) :) Happily, I have to say. I am thankful.

All posts on [flancia.org](https://flancia.org) are also automatically published on [anagora.org/@flancia](https://anagora.org/@flancia) as of the time of writing. I also write to the Agora from my digital garden as [anagora.org/@flancian](https://anagora.org/@flancian).
